# 1. Using #each, write the code to find all the numbers divisible by 3
# 2. Once you get the method below to work using #each, refactor your code to use #find_all. 


def find_all_nums_divisible_by_3
    numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
    numbers.find_all do |number|
        number % 3 == 0
    end
    ### YOUR CODE HERE
  
    # should return [3,6,9]
end
